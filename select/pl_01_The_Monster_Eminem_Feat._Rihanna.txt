I'm friends with the monster
that's under my bed
get along with the voices
inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me,
stop holdin' your breath
and you think I'm crazy yeah,
you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but
not the cover of Newsweek
oh well, guess beggars
can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention
for my music
wanted to be left alone
in public excuse me
for wantin' my cake
and eat it too and
wantin' it both ways
fame made me a ballon
'cuz my ego inflated
when I blew, see
but it was confusing,
'cuz all I wanted to do's be
the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool
when blew steam
whoo, hit the lottery ooh-wee
but with, what I gave up
to get is was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cuz I think I'm getting'
so huge I need a shrink,
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep
one sheep, two sheep, goin'
coo-coo and kooky as kool keith
but I'm actually weirder
than you think cuz I'm..
I'm friends with the monster
that's under my bed
get along with the voices
inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me,
stop holdin' your breath
and you think I'm crazy yeah,
you think I'm crazy
well that's nothin',
well that's nothin',
Now I ain't much of a poet
but I know somebody
once told me to
seize the moment and
don't squander it
'cuz you never know
when it all could
all be over tomorrow
so I keep conjurin'
sometimes I wonder where
these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponderin'll do you
wonders there's no wonder
your losin' your
mind the way it wanders,
yodalodaleheehoo, I think it
went wanderin' off down
yonder and
stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVondren,
'cuz I need a interventionist,
to intervene between me and
this monster
and save me from myself and
all this conflict
'cuz the very thing that
I love's killin' me and
I can't conquer it
my OCD's conkin' me in the
head keep knockin'
nobody's home I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice
in my head's sayin',
don't shoot the messenger
I'm friends with the monster
that's under my bed
get along with the voices
inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me,
stop holdin' your breath
and you think I'm crazy yeah,
you think I'm crazy
well that's nothin',
well that's nothin'
call me crazy but I have
this vision
one day that, I'll walk amongst
you a regular civilian
but until then, drums get
killed and I'm
comin' straight at MC's blood
gets spilled and I'll
take you back to the days
that I'd get on a Dre track,
give every kid who got played
that, pumped up feelin' and
shit to say back to the kids
who played him, I ain't here
save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of
a hundred million
who are goin' through
a struggle feels it and
relates that's great, it's
payback, Russell wilson
fallin' way back in the draft
turn nothin' into somethin still
can make that straw
into gold chump,
I will spin, Rumpelstiltskin
in a haystack, maybe I need
a straightjacket face facts,
I am nuts for real,
but I'm ok with that,
it's nuthin'
I'm friends with the monster

inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me,
stop holdin' your breath
and you think I'm crazy yeah,
